INTRODUCTION

You are in a maze of twisty little passage, all alike. Whence you came,
you do not know. Why you are imprisoned like this, you do not know,
either.

Your only hope to escape this wretched dungeon is to find the black
sphere, an ancient artifact that...um...do something to help you. Or
something like that. Don't look at me, I am only cleaning this maze. Why
should I know about this stuff?

Off you go, then. Good luck -- you might need it. And by the way, I was
told that this fog might be bad for your health, so you should better
hurry. What? You ask why I am not affected...well...um...got to go,
sorry.

CONTROLS

* Use WSAD for movement in the maze.
* Use the mouse to look around. Just don't expect to see much.
* Use Q to quit. Coward. Finding the sphere will also quit the game.
* Use SPACE to reset the camera.

CAVEAT

Due to this very message, the focus might not be given properly to the
window. If this is the case, the controls will not work as expected.
Usually, setting the focus to this window using ALT+TAB should work.

NOTES

* The maze is generated using a PRNG.
* The maze can be solved.
* The maze spans 7x7 cells, but allows larger configurations.
* The exit is placed at random.
